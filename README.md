# Maximum-Likelihood-Estimation

This is the final project for my Computation for Economics class, an intro to Python class. In this small project, I addressed the question: What key factors within Rotten Tomatoes contribute to the classification of a movie as rotten or fresh? I accomplished this by employing Maximum Likelihood Estimation and utilizing a Rotten Tomatoes database
